When you type 'https://www.google.com' into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, a complex sequence of actions unfolds behind the scenes. Your computer initiates a DNS request to translate the domain name into an IP address, enabling it to locate the destination server. Once the IP address is obtained, a TCP connection is established, facilitated by firewall security measures. The connection negotiation involves the use of HTTPS/SSL protocols to ensure secure data transmission, verified by digital certificates. To handle the incoming request, Google's highly-trafficked website likely employs load-balancing techniques to distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal performance and availability. The request is intercepted by a web server, which hosts the website's files and responds to client requests. Concurrently, dynamic content generation is facilitated by application servers, executing server-side scripts and interacting with databases to deliver personalized experiences. Behind the scenes, vast amounts of data stored in databases are accessed to provide relevant search results and content. This intricate orchestration of technologies culminates in the seamless delivery of the requested web page to your browser, completing the journey from URL input to content display
