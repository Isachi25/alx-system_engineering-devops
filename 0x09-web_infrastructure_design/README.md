### 0x09. Web infrastructure design

Overview;
Web infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware, software, and network components that collectively enable the delivery of web services and content over the internet


Web infrastructure includes servers, load balancers, web servers, application servers, databases, networking equipment, security components, monitoring tools, and logging mechanisms.

Servers store and process web content, while load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers for optimal performance.

Web servers serve web content to users' browsers, while application servers execute server-side code and handle business logic.

Databases store and manage structured data used by web applications, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Networking infrastructure facilitates communication between servers, clients, and other components of the web infrastructure.

Security components like firewalls, SSL certificates, and access controls protect against unauthorized access and security threats.

Monitoring tools collect data on system performance, availability, and security, while logging mechanisms record events for analysis and auditing.
